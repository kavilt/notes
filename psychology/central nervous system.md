# central nervous system

consists of the **brain and spinal cord**

allows you to think and make decisions

connects with **sensory receptors, muscles, and glands** through [[nerves]]

---

## brain

neurons cluster into neural networks.
- neurons that perform similar tasks will be closer

## spinal cord
connects the brain to the [[peripheral nervous system]]
- enables [[reflexes]]
- if spinal cord is severed, [[reflexes]] that do not require the brain still occur (knee jerk / pain reflex)
